# Pushpin - A reliable student-based request system.

Web App made by Wesley, Atul, and Nicholas

## What is this?

Pushpin is a web app for students who want to work as a team together in their schools. One problem that students may not have realized is that as they continue their school year, they become more disconnected with other students who have different career/degree paths. This creates a bubble that feels tough to burst, especially for those who do not have a lot of time on their hands.

Students using the web app can post requests for everyone to see. This can be something simple like asking for a ride, borrowing class textbooks, or wanting to study together. Students can also personalize their account to allow others to request those specialized in different fields. So, if someone needs a writer, they can request a writer publicly with a tag.

## Functionality

You will need to sign up first through your Google account. There, you will be able to create requests based on your needs. After requesting, it will then go to the home feed, where the user can filter some of the requests. Users can also look through their profile.
